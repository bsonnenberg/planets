###Database Assignment

# I first cleaned up the data in OpenRefine. The new dataset is attached along with the asociated JSON file. 

# I chose to create three tables in my database. 
# Table 1 Specimen = most of the columns of data
# Table 2 Location = the localities etc. 
# Table 3 Elevation = elevation data and related keys
# each table share at least one primary key. 

#Here is partial code for the creation of Table 1:

CREATE TABLE "Specimen" (
	"SpecimenID"	INTEGER,
	"Genus"	TEXT,
	"Species"	TEXT,
	PRIMARY KEY("SpecimenID")
);

#Here is partial code for the creation of Table 2:

CREATE TABLE "Elevation" (
	"SpecimenID"	INTEGER,
	"Elevation_key"	INTEGER,
	"elevation"	INTEGER,
	PRIMARY KEY("SpecimenID")
	PRIMARY KEY("Elevation_key")
);

#Code for one query that searches across two tables for 

SELECT Specimen.SpecimenID, Genus, Species, elevation, Locality
FROM Specimen
LEFT OUTER JOIN Elevation_t, Location
ON Specimen.SpecimenID = Elevation_t.SpecimenID = Location.SpecimenID
WHERE elevation > 500
